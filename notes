Objectives; 

1. define the purpose of a code test
2. read the rspec tests
3. run tests cia the learn command
4. undersand test output
5. write code to make tests pass. 


tests:

tests verify the code you write behaves and produces the desired result. 

tdd, you should think about what you want your program to do, how you want code to behaver before you start codes. 

tdd:

* first write the test for specific function of your code
* then write the code to make the tests pass. 


writing a test:

identifying the desired behavior

we need to think about what our program needs to do. what is the desired behavior of our code?

users will fill out their profile information with what year they were born. 

display how old they were on their profile page

I espect the method current_age_for_borth_year(1984) to return 31. 

Understand testing at a high level, idea is the labs come with expectations for how your code should behave and how to write the code to make those tests pass. 


* describe block, data doesn't matter
* it block, states the expectation or behavior of that method 
* between it and end, we test the functionality of our method. 


age_of_person = current_age_for_birth_year(1984)
expect(age_of_person).to eq(31)


* a test is always going to be about setting up a state with a known result and comparing that known result to the expactation to the behavior of your program. 


Running tests:

rspec spec/file.rb

* you get failure, for example:

  NoMethodError:
       undefined method `current_age_for_birth_year' for #<RSpec::ExampleGroups::CurrentAgeForBirthYearMethod:0x007fbb8b0607b8>
     # ./spec/current_age_for_birth_year_spec.rb:5:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'


problem: there is no method current_year_for_birth_year


you get another failure:

  1) current_age_for_birth_year method returns the age of a person based on the year of birth
     Failure/Error: age_of_person = current_age_for_birth_year(1984)
     ArgumentError:
       wrong number of arguments (1 for 0)
     # ./current_age_for_birth_year.rb:1:in `current_age_for_birth_year'
     # ./spec/current_age_for_birth_year_spec.rb:5:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'


problem: the method needs an argument
